## MineralsCraft_SK: A rimworld mod for the [Hardcore SK project](https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK)

![](About/Preview.jpg)

This mod is an extension of [Minerals_SK](https://github.com/zachary-foster/Minerals_SK) and must come after it in the load order.
It adds way to use minerals for crafting and adds a few new resource minerals.

## New Resource minerals

These are randomly spawned when a map is created and are never respawned in a given map.

```{r}
print_minerals("Defs/ThingsDefs_Minerals/StaticMinerals.xml")
```

### Adamant

Adamant is a mysterious and incredibly hard stone.
Little is known about the origins of this rare rock and the best
glitterworld minerologists have not found a way to explain its
formation. Some speculate that the nodes of adamant scattered around
this solar system are the remnants of planetary-scale alien structures
that were destroyed around the time this solar system begin forming.
Adamant is difficult to mine and craft with, but can be used to make
very strong walls, beautiful floors, and deadly arrows. However, it is
also rare and valuable, so possession of even a little adamant can
attract significant interest.


## Cutting gems

Some gem-quality crystals can be found when mining some minerals.
These can be cut into gems to be used for some crafting recipes or sold to traders.
Gems are particularly light and valuable, making them excellent for trading and attracting raiders.  


## Fire starting

Steel, kindling, fabirc, and a sharp stone like obsidian or flint can be used to make a fire starting kit that can be used to start fires anywhere.


## Neolithic crafting

Flint and obsidian can be used to make "tribal" tools like knives and handaxes.
They have decent armor penetration, but are very brittle, so tools will get destroyed often when used for self defense.
Flint and obsidian arrows are much better than standard stone arrows against unarmored foes.
Adamant can also be used to make arrows that have much higher armor penetration.

## Medieval crafting

Precious metals and cut gems can be used to powerful royal weapons like knives, swords, and battleaxes.
These are stronger than their unjewled analogs and provide a small social and mental break boost, but they are heavy, expensive, and difficult to craft.

## Installation

You can download the current development version by clicking the green "clone or download" button near the top of this page. You can also download specific "stable" releases [here](https://github.com/zachary-foster/MineralsCraft_SK/releases), although they will probably not be updated too often. Once you have downloaded the mod, uncompress the file and up the folder in the `Mods` folder of you rimworld installation.

## To xml modders and potential contributers:

This mod is set up so that new minerals, both static and dynamic, can be added and configured using only XML changes.
Adding:

```
<ThingDef ParentName="StaticMineralBase">
		<defName>MyNewMineral</defName>
    ...
</ThingDef>
```

or

```
<ThingDef ParentName="DynamicMineralBase">
		<defName>MyNewMineral</defName>
    ...
</ThingDef>
```

to an XML file in `Defs/ThingDefs_Minerals` will cause a new mineral to be added to the game.

To add a mineral: 

* Copy the `ThingDef` for an existing mineral that is most similar to the one you want to make. Modify the XML how you want and add it to an XML file in `Defs/ThingDefs_Minerals`. Make sure to change the `defName`.
* Create textures for the new mineral and add to them to `Textures/Things/Mineral` in the same format as the others there.
* If you want to have you changes added to this mod for others to use, consider [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). I welcome contributions!

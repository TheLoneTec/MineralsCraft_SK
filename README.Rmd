## MineralsCraft_SK: A rimworld mod for the [Hardcore SK project](https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK)

![](About/Preview.jpg)

This mod adds various mineral-related content.
For example, it adds various minable crystals underground, obsidian and flint for weapons, and living coldstone and glowstone crystals.


## New Resource minerals

These are randomly spawned when a map is created and are never respawned in a given map.

```{r}
print_minerals("Defs/ThingsDefs_Minerals/StaticMinerals.xml")
```

## Cutting gems

Some gem-quality crystals can be found when mining some minerals.
These can be cut into gems to be used for some crafting recipes or sold to traders.
Gems are particularly light and valuable, making them excellent for trading and attracting raiders.

## Obsidian/Flint crafting

Flint and obsidian can be used to make "tribal" tools like knives and handaxes.
They have decent armor penetration, but are very brittle, so tools will get destroyed often when used for self defense.
Flint and obsidian arrows are better than standard stone arrows but not as good as metal arrows.

## Installation

You can download the current development version by clicking the green "clone or download" button near the top of this page. You can also download specific "stable" releases [here](https://github.com/zachary-foster/MineralsCraft_SK/releases), although they will probably not be updated too often. Once you have downloaded the mod, uncompress the file and up the folder in the `Mods` folder of you rimworld installation.

## To xml modders and potential contributers:

This mod is set up so that new minerals, both static and dynamic, can be added and configured using only XML changes.
Adding:

```
<ThingDef ParentName="StaticMineralBase">
		<defName>MyNewMineral</defName>
    ...
</ThingDef>
```

or

```
<ThingDef ParentName="DynamicMineralBase">
		<defName>MyNewMineral</defName>
    ...
</ThingDef>
```

to an XML file in `Defs/ThingDefs_Minerals` will cause a new mineral to be added to the game.

To add a mineral: 

* Copy the `ThingDef` for an existing mineral that is most similar to the one you want to make. Modify the XML how you want and add it to an XML file in `Defs/ThingDefs_Minerals`. Make sure to change the `defName`.
* Create textures for the new mineral and add to them to `Textures/Things/Mineral` in the same format as the others there.
* If you want to have you changes added to this mod for others to use, consider [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). I welcome contributions!


## Ideas for future work

### Events

#### Minerals nearby

A visitor or trader gives you the map position to a tile with a high concentration of some mineral.
This would highlight an area with a naturally high level of that mineral and the conditions it occurs in.
When visiting the spot on the map, the natural abundance of that mineral is doubled.

#### Valuable Minerals nearby

Same as "Minerals nearby", but only happens with valuable minerals.
There is a chance that a raid will occur while you are there

#### Enemy mining camp

Same as "Valuable Minerals nearby", except there is a temporary base already there.
There would be tents and pack animals and some minerals already mined. 
A raid of the same faction might occur while there. 

#### Ancient treasure hoard

A trader of visitor offers to let you know about a hidden treasure hoard in the mountains for a price.
The treasure is in a room of a sealed off base.
There might be insects or mechs in the base and raids might occur when on the map.
In one of the rooms is lots of gems, silver, gold, jade, and jeweled weapons/apparel.

#### Hidden minerals found

One of you colonists notice some minerals on your map.
Only applies to minerals embedded in rock that might be overlooked, like gemstones and flint.

#### Strange green crystals

"A cluster of strange green crystals have been left behind by a meteor.
They are glowing and seem to be growing."

A type of proto-mechinoid terraforming event that evolves over time.

1. A single cluster of crystals are left by a meteor.
1. These grow slowly in light, but grow faster when parasitizing anything biological nearby. They begin to reproduce once big enough.
1. Once full sized, they spawn other types, some natural metal ores and some more exotic. These turn the ground they grow on to wasteland once full size.
1. Once full size crystals are spawned a fixed distance from the meteor, a type is spawned that is impassible and creates a wall and encloses an area, while other crystals continue to spread outwards.
1. Once metal ores are full size, a new type is spawned that explode into "micromech swarms". Another type produces defensive "seekers", which patrol the area and fly into any intruders with a small explosion.
1. micromech swarms begin to harvest the ores and build full size mechs which attack the colony once mature.
